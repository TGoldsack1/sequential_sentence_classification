we use higher cell densities, a longer liquid-preincubation time, and culture media higher in magnesium sulfate (essential for SULT-expressing strains) than other laboratories.", "Interestingly, deficiency of OAT reduced the response, whereas overexpression of this enzyme had practically no influence on the mutagenic activity of 2-NBA in our study.", "However, previously no influence of OAT deficiency was found, but a marked enhancement of the mutagenicity by overexpression of OAT.", "Thus, it may be suspected that OAT was more active under the experimental conditions used in the present study.", "In both studies, nitroreductase deficiency drastically reduced the mutagenic activity of 2-NBA, whereas overexpression of this enzyme enhanced the activity.", "Strains expressing a human SULT were used only in our study.", "Expression of SULT1A1 enhanced the mutagenicity of 2-NBA.", "The increase amounted to 2.8-fold using TA1538 as the recipient strain.", "It was stronger (60-fold) with the nitroreductase-deficient recipient strain YG7131, starting from a much lower background level than in TA1538.", "Thus, it may be hypothesized that human SULT1A1 was superior to the bacterial acetyltransferase in bioactivation at the low substrate concentrations of N-OH-2-ABA intermediate expected to be present in nitroreductase-deficient strains.", "In the present study it is reported for the first time that 2-NBA is capable of inducing gene mutations in mammalian cells.", "Mutagenicity was not observed in the parental V79MZ cell line, which is used in standard gene mutation, micronucleus and chromosomal aberration tests.", "However, when human NAT2 or SULT1A1 were expressed in this cell line, mutagenicity was detected even at very low concentrations of 2-NBA (0.1\u03bcM).", "Unlike 2-NBA, its metabolite N-OH-2-ABA was mutagenic in parental V79MZ cells.", "It is not known whether N-OH-2-ABA or another metabolite produced by the V79MZ cells induced the mutations.", "Expression of human NAT2 or SULT1A1 enhanced the mutagenicity of N-OH-2-ABA, in agreement with the effects observed on 2-NBA.", "Using TLC 32P-postlabeling multiple DNA adducts were detectable in V79MZ-derived cells expressing human NAT2 or SULT1A1 treated with 2-NBA (3\u03bcM) similar to those observed in human cells (see below), whereas no DNA adducts were found in the parental cell line V79MZ.", "Higher DNA binding was also observed in V79MZ-derived cells expressing human conjugating enzymes compared to parental cells after treatment with N-OH-2-ABA at the low concentration tested (0.1\u03bcM).", "Thus, expression of human conjugating enzymes NAT2 or SULT1A1 strongly contributes to the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of 2-NBA and N-OH-2-ABA as has been observed previously for 3-NBA (Arlt et al., 2002, 2003a, 2005).", " s in the modulating effects of the enzymes may be due to variations in the time course of the exposure to N-OH-2-ABA, i.e., initially high with a relatively rapid decrease when N-OH-2-ABA is directly used, lower but more continuous when it is produced by the cells from 2-NBA.", "When human cells treated with 2-NBA were used to investigate DNA adduct formation a cluster of up to five adducts were detected using TLC 32P-postlabeling.", "All of them were primarily located in a diagonal zone on the TLC plates at approximately 45\u00b0 to elution directions D3 and D4, similar to DNA adducts formed by 3-NBA (Arlt et al., 2001a, 2006; Osborne et al., 2005) and typical of DNA adducts derived from extracts of airborne particulate matter and diesel exhaust (Gallagher et al., 1991; Gupta, 1985).", "In a recent study 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts were observed in A549 and HepG2 cells by HPLC 32P-postlabeling (Nagy et al., 2007), at levels about 1/3 and 1/20, respectively, of the levels of 3-NBA\u2013DNA adduct formation.", "HepG2 cells have been proven to be a sensitive cell line to examine the genotoxicity of 3-NBA as measured by the induction of single strand breaks (comet assay) and micronuclei (Lamy et al., 2004).", "Similarly, in the present study HepG2 cells were the most sensitive human cell line but DNA adduct levels derived from 3-NBA were up to 2.5- and 14-fold higher than by 2-NBA in A549 and HepG2 cells, respectively.", "In contrast to 3-NBA, surprisingly, no DNA adduct formation was observed in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells, indicating that these human cells are not metabolically competent to activate 2-NBA.", "Since DNA adducts were detected in all human cells exposed to N-OH-2-ABA, it seems that 2-NBA is a poor substrate for nitroreductases in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells.", "MCF-7 cells are capable of activating other nitro-PAHs by simple nitroreduction leading to the formation of covalent DNA adducts (Arlt et al., 2001b; Sun et al., 2004).", "Moreover, it has been shown that DNA binding varied among different mononitropyrene isomers tested, with 4-nitropyrene binding to DNA in MCF-7 cells to a greater extent than 1- and 2-nitropyrene (Sun et al., 2004).", "Thus, it remains to be investigated which enzyme(s) are responsible for the reduction and subsequent metabolic activation of 3-NBA, but not 2-NBA, in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells.", "Nitroreduction for 3-NBA is primarily catalyzed by cytosolic nitroreductases such as NQO1 (Arlt et al., 2005; Stiborova et al., 2006).", "Therefore, further studies will focus on the ability of human NQO1 to bioactivate 2-NBA.", "In addition, investigations on the expression of cytosolic and microsomal reductases in A549, HepG2, HCT116, and MCF-7 cells after exposure to 2- and 3-NBA may help to explain these findings.", "During the preparation of this manuscript, others investigated DNA adduct formation by 2-NBA in vivo (Nagy et al., 2007).", "DNA adduct formation in F344 rats after a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg bw 2-NBA was examined by HPLC 32P-postlabeling.", "Several peaks on the HPLC related to 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adduct formation were found at an overall level approximately 80% of that formed by 3-NBA.", "In contrast, in the present study we did not detect DNA adduct formation at doses of up to 10 mg/kg bw 2-NBA after intraperitoneal treatment, after either single or repeated administration.", "Only after administration of one high dose of 100 mg/kg bw 2-NBA was a low level of DNA adduct formation detected, and then only in lung tissue.", "In the light of the detection of 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts in vivo at lower doses by Nagy and coworkers we would have expected to observe DNA adduct formation in the present study.", "It should be noted that in the two studies different strains of rats were used (Wistar vs.", "F344 rats), different routes of administration were applied (intraperitoneal vs.", "intratracheal administration), and DNA adducts were analyzed in different ways (TLC vs.", "HPLC 32P-postlabeling), but whether these or other factors account for the difference in detection of 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts between the two studies is unclear, and will require further investigation.", "Previously we found that 3-NBA characteristic DNA adducts were detectable by TLC 32P-postlabeling independently of the route of administration (oral, intraperitoneal, and intratracheal treatment), although DNA binding varied in different tissues (Arlt et al., 2001a, 2003b; Bieler et al., 2005).", "Moreover, for 3-NBA the same characteristic DNA adducts were observed by HPLC 32P-postlabeling using different routes of administration (Nagy et al., 2005a, 2006), although TLC 32P-postlabeling seems to be more sensitive (Bieler et al., 2007).", "Since DNA adducts were observed in vivo for 3-NBA under the same experimental conditions in the present study it seems that, similar to the observations made in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells described above, 2-NBA is also a poorer substrate for nitroreductases in vivo, at least in Wistar rats.", "Furthermore, although we detected DNA adduct formation in rats treated with N-OH-2-ABA, DNA binding was much lower than that of N-OH-3-ABA, suggesting that N-OH-2-ABA may also be a poorer substrate for NATs and SULTs in vivo in rats, and/or is readily metabolized to 2-ABA, a possible detoxification pathway.", "Physicochemical values have been used to estimate structure-related biological activities such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of different isomeric compounds (Borosky, 2007; Hatch et al., 2001).", "Using a semiempirical quantum mechanical approach a recent study indicated that the mutagenicity of mono-nitrated benzanthrones, including 1-, 2-, 3-, 9-, and 11-NBA, depends on the reduction potential and geometry of the nitro group attached to benzanthrone, although the differences in particular for 2- and 3-NBA were small (Takamura-Enya et al., 2006).", "It  is also noteworthy that no differences in hydrophobicity were observed among these NBA isomers, indicating that penetration into cell membranes is expected to be similar, and therefore would not be a critical determinant for their mutagenicity or DNA adduct forming potential.", "Metabolic activation of nitro-PAHs involves the formation of highly reactive arylnitrenium ions capable of reacting with DNA to form covalent DNA adducts.", "Thus, variations in the structures of the aryl moieties of 2- and 3-NBA may have profound effects on the rates of formation and/or the reactivity of their nitrenium ions (Ford and Herman, 1992) and, consequently, on their DNA adduct forming potential and mutagenicity.", "DFT is a widely applicable and robust method to calculate thermochemical parameters and charge distribution in molecular systems (Borosky, 2007; Reynisson and Steenken, 2004).", "Recently, it was shown that among a large group of aromatic and heterocyclic aromatic amines investigated, derivatives with the highest electron density on the exocyclic nitrogen, i.e., the most stable species, were the most mutagenic ones (Borosky, 2007).", "Using the DFT method we observed quite large differences in the energetics of the nitrenium ions derived from 2- and 3-NBA.", "Moreover, we found that the 3-isomer delocalizes the positive charge more effectively than the 2-isomer.", "This could mean that the greater stability of the nitrenium ion of 3-NBA provides it with more time to reach the nucleus, react with DNA and form larger amounts of DNA adducts than the nitrenium ion of 2-NBA.", "The latter may react more efficiently with cellular macromolecules in the immediate vicinity of its site of formation in the cytoplasm.", "However, other factors besides the stability of the nitrenium ions may play a role in determining the extent of DNA adduct formation.", "In summary, we found that 2-NBA is mutagenic in bacteria and mammalian short-term assays.", "In contrast to 3-NBA, 2-NBA formed DNA adducts only in some of the human cell lines studied, indicating that differences occur in the metabolic activation pathway of each isomers.", "Moreover, DNA binding by 2-NBA was generally substantially lower than by 3-NBA.", "In contrast to a recent report we found no evidence of 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adduct formation in vivo in rats at comparable doses, an observation which certainly requires further investigation.", "Using authentic 2-NBA\u2013DNA adduct standards in the future may be one step toward resolving these discrepancies.", "Structural calculations showed that physiochemical properties, or more likely a combination of both physiochemical and enzymatic properties, related to 2- and 3-NBA activation may account for their large differences in mutagenicity and DNA adduct formation."], "labels": ["OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "BAC", "BAC", "BAC", "BAC", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "BAC", "BAC", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "BAC", "BAC", "BAC", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "BAC", "BAC", "OUT", "OUT", "BAC", "BAC", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "BAC", "BAC", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT", "OUT"]}

Dean et al., 2002; Hansen, 1998; Robertson and Hansen, 2001).", "Such toxic effects suggest interactions with different cellular components other than AhR; however, exact modes of action of noncoplanar PCBs still remain unclear.", "Mechanistic studies are extremely important because of an urgent need to estimate contributions of noncoplanar congeners to overall PCB toxicity (Hansen, 1998).", "In the currently accepted toxic equivalency factors approach, which is based exclusively on AhR-mediated toxicity data, the more prevalent di-ortho-substituted PCBs have zero toxic potencies (van den Berg et al., 1998), despite their known toxicity.", "Widespread distribution and persistence of PCBs led to studies on their potential role in carcinogenesis (Silberhorn et al., 1990).", "Evidence that exposure to PCBs, as well as polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), leads to mutations has been ambiguous and controversial (Stapleton et al., 2001;
