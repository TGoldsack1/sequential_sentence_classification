Cancer Society has estimated that there will be 178 700 new breast cancer cases and ~16% of all cancer related mortality (43 500 cancer related deaths) in 1998.", "Unlike the common non-hormone-dependent adult cancers, breast cancer is exceptional before the age of 20 years and is rare below 30 years but then the incidence rises very steadily up to the age of 50 years, after which the rate of increase slows down, although the incidence rate continues to rise.", "This shows that a relationship must exist between ovarian hormones and breast cancer, although it has not been clarified which specific hormones are involved in the breast carcinogenesis (2).", "The epidemiological evidence provides strong support for this concept (3).", "From among the various recognized risk factors, age of menarche, age of first pregnancy and age of menopause suggest that endogenous sex hormones may play the predominant role at all stages in the development of breast cancer (4\u20139).", "Because of their physiologic stimulatory actions on mammary gland, oestrogens, especially oestrone and oestradiol, have long been linked to the risk of breast cancer (10).", "Epidemiological evidence derives from investigating the effects of exogenous oestrogens on the incidence of breast cancer, such as long-term use of oral contraceptive pills (11) and oestrogen replacement therapy (12), supports this linkage.", "Furthermore, animal studies have shown repeatedly that oestrogens are able to induce and promote mammary tumours, and removal of ovaries, or administration of anti-oestrogenic drugs, achieves the opposite effect (13).", "However, the epidemiological evidence linking oestrogens with breast cancer risk is provocative but not conclusive for two reasons.", "Firstly, repeated full-term pregnancies at an early age, with the consequence of long-lasting increase of oestrogenic levels, are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.", "Secondly, the highest incidence of breast cancer is observed in old women when the oestrogenic level has been very low for decades (14).", "Considerable efforts have been made in the past in attempting to show that women with high risk of breast cancer and/or those who subsequently develop the disease have abnormal endocrine profiles.", "However, comparative studies of high- and low-risk groups and familial studies have failed to yield consistent evidence that individuals' urinary and plasma oestrogen levels are associated with the increased risk (15).", "Interestingly, the evidence for urinary and plasma steroids is stronger for androgens than for oestrogens in predicting breast cancer (16).", "Based on these observations, androgens have also been proposed as a possible carcinogenic factor in breast cancer (3).", "This proposal is mainly supported by the fact that the incidence of breast cancer is high in post-menopausal women when androgenic levels are high (17).", "Furthermore, administration of androgens for cystic disease has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer (18).", "It has been reported that higher androgens and lower progesterone levels have been found in pre-menopausal women with breast cancer compared with controls (19).", "Moreover, Japanese women, who have a lower risk of breast cancer than their American and British counterparts, have lower plasma androgen levels.", "More recently, a number of researchers have demonstrated that, among all plasma steroids, the evidence for association of testosterone levels with breast cancer is strongest, although they could not determine whether this association is a cause or an effect of malignancy (20).", "However, although quite a few studies have evaluated plasma androgen levels in relation to breast cancer risk, the results have been inconsistent.", "Testosterone has been positively associated with breast cancer in most (21\u201326), but not all (27,28), previous studies.", "Furthermore, most studies suggested that increased levels of testosterone might have a modest but indirect association with breast cancer through its conversion to oestradiol (29,30).", "The uncertainty of the roles of sex hormones, especially androgens, in breast carcinogenesis is, at least in part, due to a lack of a suitable animal model to enable researchers to carry out detailed investigations.", "The two most widely used experimental systems for the study of mammary cancer involve the use of chemical carcinogens, such as 1,2-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and N-methylnitrosourea.", "These rodent models are excellent to study the early events of chemical carcinogenesis, malignant progression, and for carrying out in vivo signal transduction studies towards some oncogene-mediated events, such as ras-mediated events (31).", "However, these models, as well as other models induced by adenovirus and ionizing radiation, are not ideal for investigating mammary carcinogenesis, as they do not closely mimic the hormonal situation in normal animals.", "Noble and his colleagues had conducted pioneering studies on the induction of mammary cancer by steroid hormones in a rat strain (Noble) (32).", "Because of their interests in prostate carcinogenesis, very little details about mammary carcinogenesis were given in the report.", "Furthermore, they used estrone, one of the most cytotoxic forms of oestrogen, which is present in high levels only in post-menopausal women.", "Key (33) has reviewed the relationship of hormones and cancer in humans and suggested that sex hormones affect both early and late stages in breast carcinogenesis.", "Oestradiol is the main form of oestrogen which affects the early stage of breast carcinogenesis.", "We have developed a new animal model for mammary cancer based on Noble's method (32), with an important modification, using a combination of testosterone and 17\u03b2-oestradiol (E2), which more closely mimics breast cancer in human.", "Using this animal model, we have successfully induced the development of a high percentage of mammary cancer in female Noble rats.", "We have examined the expression of tumour growth factor-\u03b2 and vascular endothelial growth factor and their receptors in mammary cancer (34\u201336).", "We have established that an autocrine growth regulatory mechanism exists in this mammary cancer (B.Xie et al., submitted for publication).", "We have also carried out a comparative study to further investigate the role of sex hormones, especially testosterone, in mammary carcinogenesis.", "We found that prolonged treatment with a combination of oestradiol and testosterone induces much higher incidence of mammary cancer in Noble rats, than either hormone alone.", "The histopathological patterns of the induced tumours and the number of tumours per tumour-bearing animal very closely resemble human breast tumours.", "Furthermore, the dosage of testosterone, although it does not influence the cumulative tumour incidence, does affect the tumour latency period.", "This suggests that testosterone may act as a promoter in the mammary tumorigenesis.", "Thus, the study: (i) provides the first in vivo evidence that both oestrogens and androgens are important cause for mammary tumorigenesis and that androgens may work synergistically as a promoter to shorten the latency period; and (ii) offers a useful animal model for exploring the mechanisms involved in human breast carcinogenesis, especially for the evaluation of the role of androgens in mammary tumorigenesis."], "labels": ["BAC", "BAC",

present study after administration of PB at low dose, if not accompanied by induction of their gene expression leading to the tremendous elevation of OH\u2022, might have a protective effect.", "No significant differences in mRNA or protein levels of CYP3A2, CYP2B1/2 and CYP2C11 were detected in the low-dose group in both experiments, suggesting that those enzymes of the detoxification system were activated, but their gene expression was not altered.", "In contrast, P-450 isoenzymes mRNA and protein levels were conspicuously elevated in the high dose-treated groups, and the data were in line with the previously noted results (11).", "In addition, an inhibitory effect of PB on development of GST-P positive foci in a medium-term rat liver bioassay was reported previously to correlate with changes in CYP3A2 isoenzyme protein content, which was suppressed by the low and enhanced by high doses of PB (15).", "However, in this study we did not observe any effect of PB at low dose
